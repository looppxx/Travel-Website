Forget Switzerland and visit its less touristy (and more beautiful) neighbour – Austria. Vienna’s medieval architecture, cobbled streets and quaint cafes make it a charming city. Visit Salzburg, the birthplace of Mozart and take a bicycle tour of the city where the classic movie Sound of Music was filmed. While you’re in Salzburg, make a day trip to the Krimml Falls (the highest in Europe) or to Hallstatt, the oldest still-inhabited village.
