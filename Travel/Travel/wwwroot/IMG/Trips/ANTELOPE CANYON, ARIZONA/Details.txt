This slot canyon (and Instagram darling) is in the American south-west. Antelope Canyon’s Navajo name translates to ‘the place where water runs through rocks’ – an allusion to its creation through erosion. The narrow, undulating spaces between rock formations allow for vivid patterns when sunlight filters through the striated stone.
