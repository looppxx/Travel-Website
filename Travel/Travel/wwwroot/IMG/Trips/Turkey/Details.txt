Straddling Europe and Asia, Turkey has been on the list of top 10 countries in the world for years. So if you have yet to visit this East-meets-West gem, let this be the year that you do! Istanbul itself has plenty of things to keep you occupied â€“ the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Grand Bazaar and a cruise down the Bosphorus. Make sure you visit the quirky cave dwellings of Cappadocia and try hot air ballooning over its surreal landscape.
