Offering a wide array of options, South Africa is another destination that should be on your bucket list. Cape Town has consistently made it to the list of best cities to visit. Kruger National Park rivals Kenya’s Masai Mara in its wildlife safaris. Don’t miss out on visiting the Table Mountain or the Kalahari dessert. And South Africa’s wine industry is good enough to give France and Italy a run for their money!
