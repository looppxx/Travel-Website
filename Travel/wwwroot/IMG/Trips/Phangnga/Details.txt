Ao Phang Nga National Park
Extending out into Phang Nga Bay, this national park is made up of lush wilderness, stunning waterways and islands that have been formed from limestone. Khao Phing Kan, commonly referred to as “James Bond Island,” was one of the filming locations that was used for the movie “The Man with the Golden Gun.” You can also take a boat tour through caves that have been meticulously crafted by the power of nature.
