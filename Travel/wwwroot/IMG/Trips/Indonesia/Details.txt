Another country with numerous islands to explore is Indonesia. If you have time to explore only one island, let it be Bali. Explore Ubud, the cultural centre of Bali or go for a sunrise trek to Mount Agung (the highest point on the island) or Mount Batur, which is an active volcano set in a huge crater. You could also head to the beaches and go dolphin watching at Lovina.
