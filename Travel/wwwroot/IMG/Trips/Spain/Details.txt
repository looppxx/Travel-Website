Sunny Spain is a great location for a mid-season holiday in Europe. The cities of Barcelona and Madrid are of course must-dos. Don’t miss visiting the Alhambra fortress in Granda, Andalusia. Take a Flamenco class or learn to cook authentic Spanish cuisine. If possible, coincide your visit with one of Spain’s many festivals – La Tomatina, Tenerife Carnival or the famous Encierro or running of the bulls.
