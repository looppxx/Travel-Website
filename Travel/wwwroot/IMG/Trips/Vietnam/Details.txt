On your next trip to South East Asia skip the touristy Thailand and head to Vietnam instead. From the Marble Mountains in Danang to the azure waters of Nha Trag, from the backwaters of the Mekong Delta to the hustle bustle of Hanoi, the country has something for everyone. Don’t miss going to Ho Chi Minh City for its colonial architecture, exquisite cuisine and café culture.
