Despite its fiscal troubles, Greece is still one of the top 10 countries to visit. Historical Athens and Delphi with their legendary ruins are a must-visit, as are the gorgeous islands of Santorini and Corfu. Or get away from the crowds by visiting some lesser-known islands, such as Cythera and Kastelorizo. And indulge in the sumptuous Mediterranean cuisine as you contemplate the perfect sunset over the Aegean.
